# Algorithms and Data Structures
---

Programming assignments from the Stanford course on algorithms and data structures available through Coursera. Mostly done in JavaScript as a way to learn about JavaScript coming form Python. I'd say that there are much better ways to learn JS and that Python would have been a more suitable language for these classes. :]

The test cases for all the programing assignments is graciously provided by Beau Dobbin on [github](https://github.com/beaunus/stanford-algs).
