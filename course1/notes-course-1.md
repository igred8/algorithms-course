# Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
---

### chapter 1
---
 - MergeSort algorithm as a canonical example of divide and conquer algorithms.
 - Analysis of the algorithm's scaling for large input values 
   - write down the pseudo code for the algo
   - evaluate the number of operations per step
   - evaluate the number of steps (or recursions in this case)
 - multiplication of two large numbers as a programing homework
   - use the Karatsuba technique 
   - analyze its speed/scaling
